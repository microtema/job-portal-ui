# Architectural Decisions

## Use of Serverless Architecture

### Context
The need to create a scalable, flexible, and cost-efficient system for managing job postings and user profiles.

### Decision
Adopt a serverless architecture using Azure Functions for backend services.

### Rationale
- Serverless architecture reduces operational overhead.
- It scales automatically based on demand.
- Cost-efficient as you only pay for what you use.

### Consequences
- Reduces the need for dedicated server management.
- Requires monitoring for cold start issues.

## Choice of Azure

### Context
Selecting a cloud provider that offers robust serverless and cloud-native services.

### Decision
Use Azure for its comprehensive suite of cloud services and serverless capabilities.

### Rationale
- Azure offers a wide range of services that support serverless architecture.
- Strong community support and extensive documentation.
- Proven track record of reliability and performance.

### Consequences
- Ties the system to Azure's ecosystem.
- Requires knowledge and expertise in Azure services.

## Terraform for IaC

### Context
Managing cloud infrastructure as code for repeatability and version control.

### Decision
Use Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC) to manage Azure resources.

### Rationale
- Terraform provides a declarative approach to infrastructure management.
- Supports version control and automation.
- Strong community support and extensive documentation.

### Consequences
- Requires learning Terraform syntax and best practices.
- Increases initial setup complexity but reduces long-term management effort.

## Event-Driven Architecture

### Context
The need for asynchronous processing and state management for job processes.

### Decision
Implement event-driven architecture using Azure Durable Functions.

### Rationale
- Durable Functions provide a visual workflow for managing state transitions.
- Supports long-running processes and retries.
- Integrates well with other Azure services.

### Consequences
- Adds complexity to the system architecture.
- Requires monitoring and handling of event failures.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment with GitHub Actions

### Context
Automating the build, test, and deployment processes for the application.

### Decision
Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.

### Rationale
- GitHub Actions is integrated with GitHub repositories.
- Provides a flexible and customizable workflow automation tool.
- Supports a wide range of actions and integrations.

### Consequences
- Ties the CI/CD process to GitHub's ecosystem.
- Requires knowledge of GitHub Actions syntax and configurations.
